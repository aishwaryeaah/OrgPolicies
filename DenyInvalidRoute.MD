This analysis examines how two proposed Google Cloud Organization Policy constraints would interact with existing detective policies to prevent security violations. The goal is to shift from reactive detection to proactive prevention of network security misconfigurations.
Background: Current Detective Policies
Your organization currently uses three detective policies that identify network security violations after they occur:
1. Invalid Network Config Policy
Purpose: Identifies dangerous network configurations that could expose resources to the internet
Detection Logic: Flags subnets when ALL four conditions are present:

Has a 0.0.0.0/0 route (default route to internet)
Has egress firewall rules allowing traffic to 0.0.0.0/0
Private Google Access (PGA) is enabled
Has Google Compute Engine instances using the subnet

Risk Level: P2 (High Priority)
Current Action: OCEAN enforcement will delete offending firewall rules (not yet active)
Manual Action Required: Raise GCP ops ticket to modify network configurations
2. InvalidRoutes Policy
Purpose: Detects problematic routing configurations
Detection Logic: Identifies routes with 0.0.0.0/0 destinations on projects with Cross-Project Networking (XPN) connectivity
Risk Assessment: Standard is changing due to Private API access requirements
Current Action: None - observation only
Responsibility: GCP Engineering Team
3. Invalid Cinternal Networks Policy
Purpose: Ensures internal networks meet specification requirements
Detection Logic: Multiple validation checks including:

Missing internet egress block rules
Improper egress rules for 0.0.0.0/0 CIDR
Invalid address ranges (must be RFC 1918: 192.168/16 or 10/8, excluding 172.x.x.x)
Incorrect routes to C/EDMZ network ranges
Firewall rules bypassing dual-homed machine requirements

Risk Level: P2 (High Priority)
Current Action: None - manual remediation required
Visualization: Looker dashboard available for detailed analysis
Proposed Organization Policy Constraints
Policy Option 1: Network-Specific Constraint
yamlcondition: |
  resource.destRange == '0.0.0.0/0' && 
  resource.nextHopGateway.endsWith('/global/gateways/default-internet-gateway') && 
  resource.network.endsWith('/networks/test-network-dmz')
Scope: Limited to test-network-dmz network only
Prevention: Blocks creation of default internet routes specifically on the DMZ network
Policy Option 2: Organization-Wide Constraint
yamlcondition: |
  resource.destRange == '0.0.0.0/0' && 
  resource.nextHopGateway.endsWith('/global/gateways/default-internet-gateway')
Scope: All networks across the organization
Prevention: Blocks creation of any default internet routes using the default internet gateway
Detailed Impact Analysis
Impact on Invalid Network Config Policy
How This Detective Policy Works:
The Invalid Network Config policy is designed to catch a specific dangerous scenario where:

A subnet has unrestricted internet access (0.0.0.0/0 route)
Firewall rules allow outbound traffic to anywhere (0.0.0.0/0)
Private Google Access is enabled (potential data exfiltration path)
Active compute instances are present (actual risk exposure)

Prevention Impact:

Policy Option 1: Prevents condition #1 (0.0.0.0/0 route) ONLY on test-network-dmz

Effectiveness: Limited - other networks remain vulnerable
Risk Reduction: Minimal - only protects one specific network


Policy Option 2: Prevents condition #1 (0.0.0.0/0 route) across ALL networks

Effectiveness: High - eliminates a critical violation condition organization-wide
Risk Reduction: Significant - removes the foundation for this type of security violation



Business Impact:

Reduced Incident Response: Fewer P2 security violations to investigate
Operational Efficiency: Less manual ticket creation and network modifications
Compliance: Proactive adherence to security standards

Impact on InvalidRoutes Policy
How This Detective Policy Works:
The InvalidRoutes policy identifies routing misconfigurations that could:

Bypass network security controls
Create unintended internet access paths
Violate network segmentation policies
Conflict with XPN (Cross-Project Networking) designs

Prevention Impact:

Policy Option 1: Prevents bad routes ONLY on test-network-dmz

Scope: Extremely limited - single network protection
Coverage: Insufficient for organization-wide route management


Policy Option 2: Prevents bad routes across ALL networks

Scope: Comprehensive organization-wide protection
Coverage: Directly addresses the root cause of route violations
Alignment: Supports the evolving standards around Private API access



Technical Benefits:

Route Hygiene: Ensures clean, intentional routing configurations
Security Posture: Prevents accidental internet exposure
Compliance: Aligns with network architecture standards

Impact on Invalid Cinternal Networks Policy
How This Detective Policy Works:
This complex policy validates multiple aspects of internal network configurations:
Address Range Validation:

Ensures RFC 1918 compliance (192.168.x.x/16, 10.x.x.x/8)
Excludes 172.x.x.x range (not approved for cinternal use)
Validates subnet CIDR ranges for primary and secondary networks

Firewall Rule Validation:

Checks for proper egress blocking rules
Identifies unauthorized 0.0.0.0/0 egress rules
Validates ingress rules (excluding necessary Kubernetes rules)
Ensures compliance with approved address ranges

Network Perimeter Compliance:

Validates dual-homed machine requirements for C/EDMZ access
Prevents direct firewall rules to reserved network ranges
Ensures proper network segmentation

Prevention Impact:

Policy Option 1: Minimal impact - only affects routing on one network

Coverage: Does not address firewall rules, address ranges, or perimeter requirements
Effectiveness: Very limited prevention capability


Policy Option 2: Moderate impact - prevents some route-related violations

Coverage: Addresses default route issues but not comprehensive network validation
Effectiveness: Partial prevention - other violation conditions remain possible



Limitations:
Neither policy option fully addresses the comprehensive nature of cinternal network validation, which includes:

Firewall rule configurations
Address range compliance
Network perimeter requirements
Dual-homed architecture enforcement

Comparative Analysis
Policy Option 1: Network-Specific
Advantages:

Targeted protection for critical DMZ network
Lower risk of disrupting existing configurations
Easier to test and validate impact

Disadvantages:

Limited scope - only protects one network
Minimal impact on organization-wide security posture
Other networks remain vulnerable to the same issues
Requires additional policies for comprehensive protection

Use Case: Appropriate when:

Testing new policy enforcement mechanisms
DMZ network requires special protection
Other networks have different security requirements

Policy Option 2: Organization-Wide
Advantages:

Comprehensive protection across all networks
Significant reduction in security violations
Aligns with security-by-default principles
Greater return on investment for policy implementation

Disadvantages:

Broader impact may affect existing network configurations
Requires more thorough testing across multiple networks
May require coordination with multiple teams

Use Case: Appropriate when:

Organization-wide security standardization is the goal
